# Applying Computer Vision to a Drawing Game
![draw gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72708214/172028510-b0dbe402-0603-451f-9378-265c1d9e48c1.gif)

All that you need is a webcam and one hand, if you have these things, will work for you.

## How to play?

* Run **cam_painter.py**
* Show the palm of your hand to webcam (if it is not detecting well, try to make the background cleaner)
* Hold your index and middle fingers up to select pencil or rubber icons (pencil is drawing mode, rubber is erasing mode)
* Use your index finger to draw and erase (based on your selected mode) 
* After drawing what is expected, hold your index and middle fingers up and go to **Send draw**
* When you finish all 8 drawings, a window will show you how much was your score.
